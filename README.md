# Blind75 + Learning Journey

This repo started as a way to work through the [Blind 75](https://leetcode.com/list/xoqag3yj/) questions from LeetCode. Along the way, I found myself diving deeper — revisiting things I'd forgotten, learning new concepts, and practicing for what's ahead.

It's part prep, part review, and part exploration.

I'm also documenting things here **for those who come after** — so others walking the same path might find something useful.

No shortcuts, no pressure. Just progress.
